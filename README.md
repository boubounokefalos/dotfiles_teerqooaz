# Dotfiles - Teerqooaz
Setup based on bspwm

So I've decided to move to bspwm... Its a WM I saw a lot on other people's posts, never used it before and since many recommended it to me, I went on with the flow :)

PS: This is optimal for my small laptop (1280x800) but I'm not sure it will look that good in higher resolutions :)

### Setup:
* bspwm
* urxvt
* [polybar](https://github.com/jaagr/polybar)
* [rofi](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi)
* [fff](https://github.com/dylanaraps/fff)
* [promptless](https://github.com/dylanaraps/promptless)
* ncmpcpp
* [cava](https://github.com/karlstav/cava)
* [customized screenfetch script from birjolaxew](https://github.com/birjolaxew/dotfiles/blob/master/.scripts/screenfetch)
* [i3lock-fancier](https://github.com/SuperPrower/i3lock-fancier)
* dunst
* [compton(tryone fork)](https://github.com/SuperPrower/i3lock-fancier)
